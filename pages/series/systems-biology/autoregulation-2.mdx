# Dynamics of Negative Autoregulation

## How self-repression speeds up the response time of gene circuits

In the previous article, we learned that autoregulation, and in particular negative autoregulation, is a motif in biological transcriptional networks; it occurs far more than it would at random. But what, exactly, is negative autoregulation? How does it work, and how does it provide an advantage for organisms?
