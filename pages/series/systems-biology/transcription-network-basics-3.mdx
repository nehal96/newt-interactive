# Transcription Network Basics: Part Three

## Logic approximations, handling multiple inputs, and the dynamics of transcription networks

In Part Two, we looked at the two basic types of transcription factors, activators and repressors, and introduced an input function that mathematically models their behavior, the Hill function.

In this article, we'll introduce approximating this input function &mdash; capturing its essence rather than its details &mdash; so that we can more easily analyze more complex input functions, like what happens when multiple transcription factors regulate a gene. Finally, we'll introduce the topic of transcription network dynamics, or how a cell's response (to produce or not produce a protein) looks like over time.

### Logic approximations

The essence of an input function is a transition between two values &mdash; from high to low for an activator, and from low to high for a repressor &mdash; and a threshold that defines when the transition occurs.

In its simplest form, this function can be like a switch: either **off**, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = 0" />, or maximally **on**, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta" />, with the threshold for turning on or off occurring at <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="X^* = K" />. This kind of approximation is known as a **logic approximation**, and it greatly simplifies the behavior of the Hill function, or any other input function.

Mathematically, we can write this logic approximation using a **step function**. For an activator, this looks like:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* > K)" />
</div>

where <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="\theta(X^* > K)" />, the step function, is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the logical expression, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="X^* > K" />, is true or false. 

{/* Create a info section for this additional information */}
{/* The step function part can be written as:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula tex="\theta(X^* > K) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } X^* < K \\ 1 & \text{if } X^* \geq K \end{cases}" />
</div>

or, put together:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula tex="f(X^*) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } X^* < K \\ \beta & \text{if } X^* \geq K \end{cases}" />
</div> */}

For a repressor, the logic is reversed: being on, or 1, until the threshold is reached, after which it is off, or 0. This can be written as:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* < K)" />
</div>

Let's take a look at this graphically and compare it to the Hill function:

### Multiple Inputs

The primary benefit or logical approximations is that we can evaluate more complex input functions more easily. We can begin to look at genes that are regulated by multiple transcription factors and gauge their behavior with unnecessarily long calculations.

Let's look at the example of genes that are regulated by two activators. One gene might require that *both* activators are bound to the promoter in order to enable high levels of expression &mdash; like an AND gate:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*, Y^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* > K_X) \cdot \theta(Y^* > K_Y) \qquad \text{\textasciitilde} X^* \text{ AND } Y^*" />
</div>

Here, both <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="\theta(X^* > K_X)" /> and <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="\theta(Y^* > K_Y)" /> need to be 1 for the gene to express at the level <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="\beta" />. If any one is 0, the gene is not expressed.

For another gene, *either* one binding will suffice &mdash; like an OR gate:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*, Y^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* > K_X \hspace{0.75em} \text{OR} \hspace{0.75em} Y^* > K_Y) \qquad \text{\textasciitilde} X^* \text{ OR } Y^*" />
</div>

The combinations are not limited to Boolean operations. Transcription factors can also combine in an additive way:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*, Y^*) = \beta_X X^* + \beta_Y Y^*" />
</div>

Genes in multi-cellular organisms can have many inputs, occasionally more than a dozen, so you might see how quickly this can get complicated.

Even with just two transcription factors, the combinations above look pretty abstract. This section just introduces the concept; in future articles, we'll look at how exactly these logical operations &mdash; the AND and OR gates &mdash; are performed in organisms, and the benefits they provide. (We generally associate AND and OR gates with computers, but chemistry beat it by several billion years. In fact, if you think about it, a biological computer designed the non-biological one using pretty similar design principles).
