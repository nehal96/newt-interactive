# Transcription Network Basics: Part Three

## Logic approximations, handling multiple inputs, and the dynamics of transcription networks

In Part Two, we looked at the two basic types of transcription factors, activators and repressors, and introduced an input function that mathematically models their behavior, the Hill function.

In this article, we'll introduce approximating this input function &mdash; capturing its essence rather than its details &mdash; so that we can more easily analyze more complex input functions, like what happens when multiple transcription factors regulate a gene. Finally, we'll introduce the topic of transcription network dynamics, or how a cell's response (to produce or not produce a protein) looks like over time.

### Logic approximations

The essence of an input function is a transition between two values &mdash; from high to low for an activator, and low to high for a repressor &mdash; and a threshold that defines when the transition occurs.

In its simplest form, this function can be like a switch: either **off**, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = 0" />, or maximally **on**, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta" />, with the threshold for turning on or off occuring at <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="X^* = K" />. This kind of approximation is known as a **logic approximation**, and it greatly simplifies the behavior of the Hill function, or any other input function.

Mathematically, we can write this logic approximation using a **step function**. For an activator, this looks like:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* > K)" />
</div>

where <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="\theta(X^* > K)" />, the step function, is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the logical expression, <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="X^* > K" />, is true or false. 

{/* Create a info section for this additional information */}
{/* The step function part can be written as:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula tex="\theta(X^* > K) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } X^* < K \\ 1 & \text{if } X^* \geq K \end{cases}" />
</div>

or, put together:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula tex="f(X^*) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } X^* < K \\ \beta & \text{if } X^* \geq K \end{cases}" />
</div> */}

For a repressor, the logic is reversed: being on, or 1, until the threshold is reached, after which it is off, or 0. This can be written as:

<div className="flex flex-col justify-center mt-4 mb-12 mx-auto">
  <MathFormula className="text-lg" tex="f(X^*) = \beta \cdot \theta(X^* < K)" />
</div>

Let's take a look at this graphically and compare it to the Hill function:
