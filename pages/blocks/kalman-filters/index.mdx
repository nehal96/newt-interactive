# Kalman Filters

## How to efficiently combine uncertain information to make predictions in a continuously changing 1D environment

In the [Simple Robot Localization block](/blocks/robot-localization), we saw how we combined uncertainty in a robot's position and robot's movement to eventually gain more confidence about the location of the robot.

But this was for **discrete** movement. In the real world, movement is **continuous**. Cars and ice skaters don't instantaneously teleport from one position to another &mdash; they drive gradually over a road or glide gracefully over ice.

In this block, we're going to introduce a simplified version of a very powerful algorithm that combines uncertainty of position and uncertainty of measurement to make predictions with increased confidence: the Kalman filter.
