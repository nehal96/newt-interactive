# Simple Robot Localization

## The algorithm behind how a robot finds its location in a simple environment

All robots, from the cute little toy dogs and Roombas to self-driving cars, have to be able to understand the environment they're in and move around in it. They might use infrared sensors, lasers, or cameras to perceive their surroundings, and might use legs, wheels, or propellers to move around, but regardless of their configuration, they follow a similar cycle â€” gather data by *sensing* their environment, perform some calculation, and *move*.

In the interactive explainer below, we're going to see how this works in a very simplified environment. There are several characteristics that make the situation simple:

1. The robot's world is two-dimensional
2. The robot's movement is **discrete**, rather than continuous. This means that the robot instantly jumps from one cell to another, rather than drives or walks there.

The interactive below has three sections: a general overview, a walkthrough explaining the algorithm, and a playground to experiment. Enjoy!
